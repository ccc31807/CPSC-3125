Hello, CPSC-3125 Students,

This information contains information about this class. I know you are excited and anxious to get started, so here is something to get started on.

First, you can access the current syllabus as [CPSC-3125 Fall Syllabus](https://github.com/ccc31807/CPSC-3125/blob/master/cpsc3125syllabus2021Fall.pdf). This is provisional, but it won't change much, if at all. This Github repository contains all the class assignments.

Second, you can access the required text at [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). This is a free book, but you can purchase a hard copy for a modest cost, and I would encourage you to do so.

Third, you will need to configure your system to write, compile, and run C programs. You can download the GCC compiler at [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/). If you have a Windows machine you should also make sure you have access to a Linux machine. You can check out Cygwin if you want.

Fourth, you have homework assignments for each chapter through chapter 37. A written deliverable for each homework assignment is *required*. If you want, you can begin work on these. We will be discussing this material in class, and I will expect you to be familiar with each week's material at the beginning of each class. Please note that this class will not be especially strenuous or time consuming, but you should allocate sufficient time in your schedule to complete all assignments.

Finally, we will be reading and writing programs written in C. I will not be teaching C as such, but we will have a series of C tutorials. You may want to start exploring C on your own if you are not familiar with it.

I hope you have a great two weeks before the beginning of class, and I will see you August 17. You can reach me at carter_charles@columbusstate.edu. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions or concerns.

Charles Catter.
